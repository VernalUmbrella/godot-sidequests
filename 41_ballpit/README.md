# Ballpit

Complexity: ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ (4/10)

## Quest Objective

Create a 2D room in which balls bounce around.

## Notes

- In this quest we'll play around with the physics system!
- Make a `ball.tscn` scene of type `RigidBody2D` and ensure it has a
`CollisionShape2D` node.
- Place some `StaticBody2D` nodes in the room to act as walls and floors.

## Bonus Objectives

- [ ] Create a new ball wherever the player clicks.
- [ ] Add a gravity slider.
