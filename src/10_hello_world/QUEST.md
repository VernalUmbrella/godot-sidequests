# Hello World!

Complexity: ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ (1/10)

## Quest Objective

Create text that says "Hello World!" on screen.
It should be visible when you click Run Scene or press F6.

## Notes

- In this sidequest you'll learn to place nodes into the game that the
player can see!
- The **Quest Objective** can be completed entirely in the editor, without
writing any code. However, some of the Bonus Objectives **will** require code.

## Bonus Objectives

- [ ] Make the text start off hidden, only appearing when a certain key or
mouse button is pressed (you decide which button).
- [ ] Make the text constantly follow the mouse cursor's position.
- [ ] Add some text effects (bold, dropshadow, recolor, etc.) to your
liking, **without** importing an additional font.
