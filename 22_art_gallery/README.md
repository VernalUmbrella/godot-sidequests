# Art Gallery

Complexity: ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ (2/10)

## Quest Objective

Display an image when the scene is run.

## Notes

- If you've created your own art before, now's your chance to see it on display!
- The **Quest Objective** can be completed entirely in the editor, without
writing any code. However, some of the Bonus Objectives **will** require code.
- Images can be shown as either `Node2D` (blue, objects in world)
or `Control` (green, objects over UI) nodes.
For this project, both will work pretty much the same,
with the exception that animations require `AnimatedSprite2D`.

## Helpful Documentation

- [Sprite2D - Class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite2d.html)
- [TextureRect - Class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texturerect.html)

## Bonus Objectives

- [ ] Play an animated image (you will probably want to use a spritesheet).
- [ ] Add support for switching between multiple images.
  - [ ] Add smooth transitions between images (think *PowerPoint* animations).
